* US hospitals have tons of surplus equipment they no longer use or need (or they're expired).
* There are tons of hospitals in 3rd world countries (or poorer parts of the US) that would love to have these things and would pay to have them shipped.
* Upon successful receipt of the items, we can have the receivers verify it through the site and send a "receipt" for donor tax purposes. There can also be some kind of internal rating mechanic to weed out bad donors.
* We can verify validity of US non-profits or hospitals by their publicly available 501-c3 info.
* People who have can basically say they have X items, they work or don't work, and have their contact info. Verified organizations can send a request for items to the donors  and shipment can be worked out between the parties.
* We have access to a physician who can be an external stakeholder and has various contacts in different organizations that would be eligible.
